The average velocity for an object in one axis, for example x, that is defined as the component of displacement $\Delta{x}$ divided by the time interval $\Delta{t}$ 

Equation for finding average velocity: $v_{av,x}=\frac{x_2-x_1}{t_2-t_{1}}=\frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{t}}$

Make sure that $t_2$ is greater than $t_1$ , and if you want to calculate average velocity with respect to the y-axis instead of the x-axis, just change the variable to y

$\Delta$ just signifies a change in a value

Average velocity is a vector quantity, and the above equation defines that one-directional vector
