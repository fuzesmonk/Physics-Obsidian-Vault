Average acceleration is quantified as the change in velocity over time of an object
Is a vector

Average acceleration: $a_{av,x} = \frac{v_{2x}-v_{1x}}{t_2-t_1} = \frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{y}}$
Units: $m/s^{2}$
Is a vector
Just because acceleration is negative does not mean object is speeding down, nor does acceleration being positive mean the object is speeding up


Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration of an object at a specific point/time

Instantaneous acceleration: $a_{x} = \lim_{\Delta{t} \rightarrow 0}{\frac{\Delta{V_x}}{\Delta{t}}}$
Units: $m/s^2$

Just because $a_x > 0$, does not mean that the object is speeding up
Same principle applies if $a_x < 0$ 
And just because $a_x = 0$ does not mean that the velocity of the object is zero
