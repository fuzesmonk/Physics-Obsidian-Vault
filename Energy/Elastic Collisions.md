Elastic: When the total kinetic energy of the system is the same after the collision as before

Ex. Billiard Balls

Equations for when the collision is a head on collision between a stationary object  and a moving object:
$V_{A,f}=\frac{m_{a}-m_{B}}{m_{a}+m_{B}}\cdot v_{A,i}$ 
$V_{B,f}=\frac{2m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{B}}\cdot v_{A,i}$

$V_{A,f}$ is the final velocity of object A
$V_{B,f}$ is the final velocity of object b
The initial velocity of object B is assumed to be zero as it is at rest
