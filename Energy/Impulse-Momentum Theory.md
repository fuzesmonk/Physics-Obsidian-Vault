When a force acts upon an object over a time interval $\Delta{t}=t_{f}-t_{i}$ 
the change in the object's momentum is equal to the impulse of the force acting on the object

Equation: $\Delta{\vec{F}}=\vec{F}\Delta{t}=\vec{J}$ 

$\Delta{\vec{p}}$ is the final momentum of the object minus the initial momentum of said object

To find the average force $\vec{F_{avg}}$ , even when $\vec{F}$ isn't constant, the impulse $\vec{J}$ is defined as $\vec{J}=\vec{F_{avg}}(t_{f}-t_{i})$
