When a force acts on an object, the object's change in momentum depends on the force and on the time interval during which it acts

This is defined as the impulse, or the change in momentum associated with a force acting on  an object over a short period of time

Definition:
When a constant force $\vec{F}$ acts on an object, the impulse denoted by $\vec{J}$ is the force multiplied by the time interval during which it acts:

$\vec{J}=\vec{F}(t_{f}-t_{i})=\vec{F}\Delta{t}$ 

Units: $kg\cdot{m/s}$
