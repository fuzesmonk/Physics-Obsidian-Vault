Perfectly inelastic: The colliding objects stick together and move as one object after the collision

$\vec{p}$ is conserved
$m_{A}(v_{1_{before}})+m_{B}(v_{2_{before}})=(m_{A}+m_{B})(V_{1,2_{after}})$  

So when you find the final velocity of the object:
$v_{f,x}=\frac{m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{B}}\cdot(V_{A,i,x})$
