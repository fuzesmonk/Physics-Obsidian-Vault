Unit: Joule
Defined as $J=\frac{kg{\cdot}m^{2}}{s^{2}}=N\cdot{m}$  

$F\cdot \Delta{x} = \frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mv_{0}^{2}$
Usually represented as $KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ 

m is the object's mass in kgs
v is the objects velocity in $m/s^{2}$ 

If there isn't any displacement, zero joules of work is done on the object
