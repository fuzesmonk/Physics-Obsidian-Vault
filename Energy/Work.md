$W=\vec{F}{\cdot}\Delta{\vec{x}}$ 
$W_{f}=|\vec{F}||\vec{\Delta{x}}|\cos{\Theta_{f}}$
$\Theta$ is the angle between $\vec{F}$ and $\Delta{x}$ 
$\Theta$ also accounts of the portion of the force that will affect the object's  ability to move in the direction it's trying to go

Total work:
$W_{total}=\Delta{KE}$ 
$W_{total}=KE_{f}-KE_{i}$

When in relation to gravity, it is the negative of the change in gravitational potential energy: 
$W_{Fg}=mgy_{f}-mgy_{0}$
