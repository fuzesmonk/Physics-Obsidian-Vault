Archimedes' Principle: The buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid the object displaces

Verbose: When an object is completely or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the object equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced by the object

Equation: $B=\rho_{fluid}\cdot V_{displaced}\cdot g$   

For an object to float in a fluid, the upward force exerted on the object by the surrounding fluid must equal the weight of the object
This upward force is called the **buoyant force**
 Of note: 
 - An object does not need to have the same weight as the fluid it replaces
 - For an object to float, the object's density must be less than that of the fluid, and conversely if the object's density is higher than that of the fluid, it would sink
