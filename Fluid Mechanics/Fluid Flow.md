There are different kinds of fluids and fluid flow

An **Ideal Fluid** is a fluid that is incompressible and has no internal friction, A.K.A viscosity

If the overall flow pattern does not change with time, it is called **steady flow** 
**Laminar Flow** is special type of steady flow, since it is when adjacent layers of fluid slide smoothly past each other

At high pressure or when boundary surfaces suddenly change in velocity, the flow becomes chaotic and irregular, or **turbulent flow**
