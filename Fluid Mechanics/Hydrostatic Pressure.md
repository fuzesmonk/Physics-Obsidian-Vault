Verbose: At a point $p$ in a fluid, pressure is the ratio of the perpendicular force $F_{\pm}$ on a small area $A$

We know that $\rho=\frac{m}{v}$ so we can rewrite it so that mass is in terms of volume and density:
$m=\rho V$
$m$ is mass
$V$ is volume
$\rho$ is [[Density|density]]
 
Function: $P=\frac{F_{\pm}}{A}$, $F_{\pm}=PA$
Units: $\frac{N}{m^{2}}$ or $Pa$


$P_{liquid}=\frac{m_{liquid}*g}{A}$
$P_{liquid}=\frac{\rho_{liquid}Ahg}{A}$
and since A cancels
$P_{liquid}=\rho_{liquid}gh$
and this is the pressure of a liquid at a depth below the surface([[Variation of Pressure with Depth|1]])

In a closed container, the pressure below the surface of a liquid is $p=\rho gh$
And above the surface it is $P_{0}$

In an open container, the equation to find the pressure below the surface is the same as the one in a closed container, while the pressure above the fluid is equal to 1 atm or $1.0.13*10^{5}$ Pascals(usually)

Absolute pressure A.K.A Gauge Pressure: $P_{absolute}=P_{0}+P_{of a liquid}$
$P_{0}$ is usually $P_{atm}$ 



To note:
- Pressure is a scalar quantity
- $1 \frac{N}{m^{2}}==1 Pa$
