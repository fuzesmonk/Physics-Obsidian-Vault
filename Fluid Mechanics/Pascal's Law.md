Verbose: Pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel. The pressure depends only on depth; the shape of the container does not matter

Defined as: $p=\frac{F_{1}}{A_{1}}=\frac{F_{2}}{A_{2}}$ and $F_{2}=\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}\cdot F_{1}$
