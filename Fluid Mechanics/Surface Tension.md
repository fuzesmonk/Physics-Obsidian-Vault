Verbose: The surface tension $\gamma$ is the ratio of the magnitude $F$ of the surface force to the length $d$, which is perpendicular to the force, along which the force acts

Defined as: $\gamma=\frac{F}{d}$
Units: $\frac{F}{m}$

Of note:
- $\gamma$ is a property of the liquid, which you look up in a table
- $F$ is the force applied to a boundary of length $d$
