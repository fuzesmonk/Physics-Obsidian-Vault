Building upon [[Pressure in a Fluid]]:

Since fluids have a weight, the amount of pressure exerted on an object by the fluid grows as the object goes deeper

At a depth $h$, pressure is defined as: $p=p_{atm}+{\rho}gh$
Units: $\frac{N}{m^{2}}$ or $Pa$

To note:
- $p$ is the pressure at $h$ below the open surface of a liquid
- In water, pressure increases by 1 atm every 10 meters of depth


If at a point the pressure is equal to $p_{1}$, the pressure at depth $h$ is: $p_{2}=p_{1}+{\rho}gh$
Units: $\frac{N}{m^{2}}$ or $Pa$

To note:
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity
- $h$ is the depth at point $p_{2}$ and is positive
