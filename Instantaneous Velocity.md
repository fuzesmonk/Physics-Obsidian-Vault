#Motion




Defined as the velocity at a specific time or point along a path

Called the limit of $\frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{t}}$ as $\Delta{t}$ approaches zero, found by taking the derivative of x with respect to t/

$v_{x} = \lim_{\Delta{t} \rightarrow 0}{\frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{t}}}$
with the units being meters/second

Is a vector
Can also be found on a graph of position vs time, where the instantaneous velocity is equal to the slope of the tangent line at a specified point
