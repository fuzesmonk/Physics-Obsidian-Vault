Verbose Definition: "When Hooke's Law is obeyed, the volume strain is *proportional* to the volume stress. The corresponding constant ratio of stress is called the **bulk modulus**, denoted by $B$ "

Function: $B=-\frac{\Delta{p}}{\Delta{V}/V_{0}}$
Units: $\frac{N}{{m^{2}}}$
The negative makes sure that $B$ is positive

An increase in pressure is always caused by a decrease in volume
