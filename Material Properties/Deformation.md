Two Types of Deformation:

Elastic: When a force is applied to an object which deforms, it will return to its original shape once the force is taken away

Plastic: When a force is applied to an object and deforms, the object will not return to its original shape

If enough force is applied, the object will eventually break 

The amount of force required to cause plastic or elastic deformation, also called the breaking stress, or in the case of tensile stress it is called tensile strength,  changes from material to material
