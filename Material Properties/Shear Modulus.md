Verbose Definition: "If the forces are small enough so that Hooke's Constant  is obeyed, the shear strain is proportional to the shear stress"

Function: $S=\frac{Shear\space Stress}{Shear \space Strain}=\frac{F_{\parallel}/A}{x/h}=\frac{h}{A}\frac{F_{\parallel}}{x}=\frac{F_{\parallel}/A}{\phi}$
Units: Pa, Pascals

Only solid objects have a shear modulus
$\phi$ is the angle to which the object is bent by the shear stress
$x$ is the distance the object is bent by the shear stress
For most materials, $S$ is usually one-third to one-half as large as $Y$
