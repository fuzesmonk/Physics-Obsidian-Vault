Verbose Definition: The ratio of displacement $x$ to the transverse dimension $h$

Function: $Shear\space Strain=\frac{x}{h}=\tan{\phi}$
Units: None

$x$ is the distance that the top of the object is bent relative to the force
$\phi$ is the angle through which the object is bent by the shear force
Usually, $x\ll h$ and $\tan{\phi}\approx \phi$ where $\phi$ is defined in radians
