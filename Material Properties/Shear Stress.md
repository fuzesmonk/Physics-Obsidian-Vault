Verbose Definition: The force $F_{\parallel}$ tangent to a material's surface, divided by the area $A$ of the surface on which the force acts

Equation: $Sheer\space Stress=\frac{F_{\parallel}}{A}$
Units: Pa, Pascals

For systems in equilibrium, shear stress can only occur in solid materials as a fluid would just flow in response to the tangential force
