Verbose Definition: For a sufficiently small tensile or compressive stress, stress and strain are proportional, similar to [[Elastic Modulus A.K.A Hooke's Law|Hooke's Law]]. This proportionality constant is called **Young's Modulus**


Young's Modulus differs from material to material, and while most materials have similar compression and tensile stress values, some materials like carbon fiber composites do not

Defined as: $Y=\frac{Tensile\space Stress}{Tensile\space Strain}$
Or as: $Y=\frac{F_{\parallel}A}{\Delta{l}/l_{0}}$= $\frac{l_{0}}{A}\frac{F_{\perp}}{\Delta{l}}$

Units: Pascals, Pa

Of Note:
Hard materials have a larger $Y$ value as compared to soft materials
$A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object
$l_{0}$ is the undeformed length
