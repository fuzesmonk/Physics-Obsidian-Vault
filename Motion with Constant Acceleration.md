#Motion 

When the velocity changes at the same rate throughout the motion

Defined as: $v_x = v_{0x} + a_{x}t$
Units: m/s


To find position at time $t$: $x = x_0 + v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_{x}t^{2}$
Units: most commonly meters
$x_0$ is the position at $t=0$
$v_{0x}$ is the velocity at $t=0$
$a_x$ is the acceleration
$x$ is the position at later time $t$
