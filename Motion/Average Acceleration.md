Average acceleration is quantified as the change in velocity over time of an object
Is a vector

Average acceleration: $a_{av,x} = \frac{v_{2x}-v_{1x}}{t_2-t_1} = \frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{y}}$
Units: $m/s^{2}$
Is a vector
Just because acceleration is negative does not mean object is speeding down, nor does acceleration being positive mean the object is speeding up
