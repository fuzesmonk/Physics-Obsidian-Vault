When an object is traveling along a path that is a uniform circle, the object is accelerating as the direction of its velocity is changing, even if the object has a constant speed.

Defined as: $a_{rad}=\frac{v^2}{R}$ 
Units: $m/s^{2}$ 

Notes: 
- The direction of the velocity is changing, but so does the acceleration vector
- Radial acceleration increases as the square of the speed
