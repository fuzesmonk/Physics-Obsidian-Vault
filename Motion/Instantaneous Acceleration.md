Instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration of an object at a specific point/time

Instantaneous acceleration: $a_{x} = \lim_{\Delta{t} \rightarrow 0}{\frac{\Delta{V_x}}{\Delta{t}}}$
Units: $m/s^2$

Just because $a_x > 0$, does not mean that the object is speeding up
Same principle applies if $a_x < 0$ 
And just because $a_x = 0$ does not mean that the velocity of the object is zero
