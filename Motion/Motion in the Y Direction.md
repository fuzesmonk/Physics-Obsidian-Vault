Very similar to the motion with constant acceleration equations, but all motion is in respect to the y-axis.

Equations:
$v_{y}=v_{0y}-gt$ 
$y=y_{0}+v_{0y}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$ 
$v_{y}^{2}=v_{0y}^{2}-2g(y-y_{0})$ 

Be careful here as g can change depending on the gravitational acceleration that is defined, which on earth is approximately 9.81 $m/s_{2}$ 
$y_{0}$ and $v_{0y}$ are the position and velocity of an object at $t=0$
