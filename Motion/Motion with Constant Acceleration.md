.When the velocity changes at the same rate throughout the motion

Defined as: $v_x = v_{0x} + a_{x}t$
Units: m/s

To find velocity when given two points, $v_0$, and $v_x$
$v_{x}^{2}=v_{0x}^{2}+2a_{x}(x-x_{0})$ 
units: $m^{2}/s^{2}$


To find position at time $t$: $x = x_0 + v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_{x}t^{2}$
Units: most commonly meters
$x_0$ is the position at $t=0$
$v_{0x}$ is the velocity at $t=0$
$a_x$ is the acceleration
$x$ is the position at later time $t$

To find acceleration without t: $a=\frac{v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}{2S}$
S is the displacement
