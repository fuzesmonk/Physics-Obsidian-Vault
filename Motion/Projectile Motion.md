Assuming $a_{x}=0$ and $a_{y}=-g$ :
For X motion:
$v_{x}=v_{0x}$
$x=x_{0}+v_{0}t$ 

For Y motion:
$v_{y}=v_{0y}-gt$
$y=y_{0}+v_{0}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$ 

$v_{0x}$ and $v_{0y}$ represent their respective part of the initial velocity vector
$v_{x}$ and $v_{y}$ represent their respective components of the velocity at time $t$ 
$x_{0}$ and $y_{0}$ represent their respective components of objects initial position
$x$ and $y$ represent their respective components of the objects position at time $t$
