When an object is at rest **or moving with constant velocity**, the vector sum of all the forces acting on it **must** be zero

Defined as: $\Sigma{\vec{F}}=0$ 
Notes:
This is only when the object can be treated as a particle 

In component form the same is true:
$\Sigma{F_{x}}=0$ , $\Sigma{F_{y}}=0$
