Vector Form: $\Sigma{\vec{F}}=m\vec{\textbf{a}}$ 
Units:
$\vec{F}$ is defined in Newtons or N
Acceleration: $m/s^2$ 
To Remember:
If $\vec{a}=0$ the net force applied to the object is zero

When working in More than one direction, use the component form:
$\Sigma{F_{x}}=ma_{x}$ , $\Sigma{F_{y}}=ma_{y}$ 

Things to Notes:
Have to find the components of every force acting upon the object
If either acceleration component is zero, the total acceleration is zero
