Verbose Definition: Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

Function Definition: $F_{g}=G\cdot \frac{{m_{1}m_{2}}}{r^{2}}$
Units: Newtons
$r$ is distance between the centers of  $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$
$G$ = gravitational constant, defined as $6.674*10^{-11}$ $\frac{{N*m^{2}}}{kg^{2}}$
