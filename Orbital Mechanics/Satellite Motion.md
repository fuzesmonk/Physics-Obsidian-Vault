The main law governing a satellite's motion is Newton' Second Law, where $\vec{F} = F_{g}$ and $a=\frac{{v^{2}}}{r}$

So the rewritten version of the equation $F=ma$ to handle the motion of a satellite is: $\frac{Gmm_{P}}{r^{2}}=\frac{{mv^{2}}}{r}$

Finding the velocity is as simple as moving variables around, giving the equation: $v=\sqrt{\frac{{Gm_{P}}}{r}}$
Units: m/s
$r$ is the orbit radius
