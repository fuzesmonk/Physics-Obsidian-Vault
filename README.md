# Physics-Obsidian-Vault

Best used when opened with the program [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

This repo serves as a version control of all of my physics notes that are contained in one obsidian vault, controlled by the [Obsidian Git plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git).

To make it easier to format LaTeX equations in the .md files, I used the [Quick LaTeX for Obsidian plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=quick-latex) and the [Editor Syntax Highlighting plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian).

Each folder contains all of the files pertaining to the folder's subject, and the tags are used to sort the markdown files into their respective folders, using the [Auto Note Mover plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=auto-note-mover)
