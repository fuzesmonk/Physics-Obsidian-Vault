$L=mvl$
Units: $\frac{kg\cdot m^{2}}{s}$
To note:
- $l$ is the perpendicular distance from the point O on the axis of rotation to the trajectory line of the particle
- Although a particle may be traveling in a straight line, it still can have angular momentum about some axis
- If the particle is headed directly toward or away from the point $O$ on the axis of rotation, then its angular momentum about that point is zero
