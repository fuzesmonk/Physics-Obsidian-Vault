Is the rotational version of the linear momentum equation: $\vec{\textbf{p}}=m\vec{v}$

Verbose Definition: When a rigid body with moment of inertia $I$ rotates with angular velocity $w$ around a specified axis, the angular momentum of the body with respect to that axis is the product of the moment of inertia $I$ about the axis and the angular velocity $w$

Equation Definition: $L=Iw$
L is the angular momentum, with its unit being $\frac{kg \cdot m^{2}}{s}$
It is a vector quantity


If the axis does not move with respect to the rotating object, then $I$ is constant
In accordance to the above trait of  $I$:
$I\alpha=I\frac{\Delta{w}}{\Delta{t}}=\frac{\Delta{Iw}}{\Delta{t}}=\frac{\Delta{L}}{\Delta{t}}$

**IDENTITY**:
Verbose: The rate of change of angular momentum of a rigid body with respect to any axis equals the sum of the torques of the forces acting on it with respect to that axis

Equation: $\Sigma{\tau}=\frac{\Delta{L}}{\Delta{t}}$
To consider:
- If $\Sigma{T}=0$, then the angular momentum of the body is constant and does not change with time
- If the angular momentum of a rigid body is constant, then the sum of the external torques on that body must be zero

Note:
As with all angular quantities, angular momentum is defined with reference to a particular axis of rotation. It is essential to specify this axis and use it consistently when applying the principles we've just discussed
