When an object is moving at a constant speed around the arc of a circle: $a_{rad}=\frac{v^{2}}{R}$ 
$a_{rad}$ is radial acceleration
$v$ is speed
$R$ is the radius of the circle
Units: $m/s^{2}$
Referred to as centripetal acceleration

To define the velocity of an object moving around a circle:
$v=\frac{{2\pi{R}}}{T}$

To find the acceleration:
$a_{rad}=\frac{{4\pi^{2}{R}}}{T^{2}}$
