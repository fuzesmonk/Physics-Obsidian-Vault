An object's acceleration towards the center of a circle must be caused by a force/group of forces who's vector sum points to the center of the circle while staying constant

$F_{net}=m\cdot \frac{{v^{2}}}{{R}}$
IMPORTANT: the quantity above is not a force, it is the acceleration part of the $\Sigma{\vec{F}}=m\vec{a}$
