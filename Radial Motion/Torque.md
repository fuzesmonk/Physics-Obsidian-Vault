Torque is the quantitative measurement of the tendency of a force to cause or change rotational motion around a chosen axis. It is the product of the magnitude of the force and the movement arm, which is the perpendicular distance between the axis and the line of action for the force

Defined as: $\vec{\tau} = Fl$

Units: newton-meter
Is a Vector
IMPORTANT: While torque is defined in newton-meters, that does not mean it is defined in joules. This is due to torque not being work or energy

In terms of the tangential component of the force: $\vec{\tau} = F_{{tan}^{r}}=(F\sin{\phi})r$
Units: N*m

$r$ is the distance between the point where the force is acting and the axis of rotation
$\phi$ is the angle between vectors

Torque and Centripetal acceleration are linked with the equation $\Sigma{\tau}=I\alpha$
This is the torque equivalent of F=ma
$\alpha$ is in $rad/s^{2}$
$I$ is in $kg\cdot m^{2}$
$\tau$ is in $N\cdot m$

Torque caused by internal forces should add to zero, like the action-reaction pairs from [[Motion]], so the torques on a body that should be considered should only be external torque forces
