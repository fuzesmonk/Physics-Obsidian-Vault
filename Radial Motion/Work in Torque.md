$\Delta{W}=F_{tan}R\Delta{\theta}$
Simplified: $\Delta{W}=\tau\Delta{\theta}$
**Has to be defined in terms of radians not degrees**
If a constant torque is applied to a body:
$W=\tau(\theta_{2}-\theta_{1})=\tau\Delta{\theta}$
$W$ is in joules
$\tau$ is in Newton-meters
$\theta$ is in radians
$\Delta{\theta}=\theta_{f}-\theta_{i}$

Is the rotational equivalent of $W=F\cdot d$
