Conservation of Energy: $E=\frac{1}{2}kA^{2}=\frac{1}{2}mv_{x}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$
Units: Joules
$v_{x}$ is the speed of an object at an arbitrary time in the motion
$x$ is the position of an object at an arbitrary time in the motion
$E$ is the total mechanical energy of the system, assuming it to be a lossless system
In SHO systems, energy transfers between the kinetic energy of the object and the potential energy of the spring
