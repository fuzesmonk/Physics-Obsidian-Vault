Frequency: $f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$
Units: Hertz, Hz
$\omega$ is in $rad/s$
The period is then defined as the reciprocal of the frequency($\frac{1}{f}$) as demonstrated below:
$T=\frac{1}{f}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$
Units:
$T$ is in seconds

Of Note:
The frequency of a SHO does not depend on the amplitude of the motion
$\omega$ is the angular frequency, not angular velocity in a SHO
