Verbose: Interference is when two or more periodic waves with the same frequency overlap in the same region of space

Two types of Special Interference:
Constructive: When the anti-nodes of two or more waves align, there is an increase in amplitude due to interference

Destructive: When the positive anti-node of one wave lines up with the negative anti-node of another wave, there is a decrease in amplitude due to interference
Example: Noise cancelling headphones
