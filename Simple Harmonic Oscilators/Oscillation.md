Oscillation is when an object repeats the same motion over and over again(ex. guitar strings)

ONLY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLATORS IS THE RESTORING FORCE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE DISPLACEMENT
This is also referred to a periodic motion

Amplitude: Denoted as $A$, is the maximum magnitude of displacement from equilibrium, which is always positive. Total range is defined as $2\cdot A$

Cycle: One complete trip of an object's motion

Period: Denoted as $T$, it is the time required for one full cycle, found by using the function $T=\frac{1}{f}$

Frequency: Denoted as $f$, It is the number of cycles in a unit of time, Usually its unit is Hertz, abbreviated as Hz, and described as $1 Hz=1\space cycle/s=1s^{-1}$, is found by using the function $f=\frac{1}{T}$

Angular Frequency: Denoted as $\omega$, it is $2\pi$ times the frequency, and represents the rate of change of an angular quantity which is measured in radians, so angular frequency's unit is usually $rad/s$, which can also be found by using the function $\omega=2\pi{f}=\frac{2\pi}{T}$
