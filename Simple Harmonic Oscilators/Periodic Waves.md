This equation can be used to find the displacement of a point along the wave, either along the x or y axis
Periodic wave on a string: $y(x,t)=A\sin{2\pi}(\frac{t}{T}-{\frac{x}{\lambda}})$
$x,y,\lambda,A$ are all in meters
$T,t$ are in seconds

$y(x,t)$ represents a sinusoidal wave traveling in the $+x$ dimension
It is the transverse displacement of the string as a function of both position on the string and time
