Elastic Potential Energy: $u_{s}=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$
$k$ is the spring constant in N/m 
$x$ is displacement from equilibrium

Spring Force: $F_{spr}=k\Delta{L}$
$k$ is the spring constant
$\Delta{L}$ is the amount the spring is compressed or stretched
This equation only gives the magnitude of the force

Restoring Force: $F_{x}=-kx$
Units: Newtons
