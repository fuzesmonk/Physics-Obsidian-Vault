All mechanical waves must travel through a material or substance, called a medium
The properties of the wave rely on the properties of the medium
All waves have an equilibrium state


Two types of waves:
1. Transverse: Wave disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation $\updownarrow$
	1. $y(x,t)=A\cos{kx-\omega{t}}$ 
	2. $k=\frac{{2\pi}}{\lambda}$ 
2. Longitudinal: Wave disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation $\leftrightarrow$ 
	1. Example: Sound waves
