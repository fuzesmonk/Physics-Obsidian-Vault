Frequency of a wave: $f=\frac{i}{T}$
Angular Frequency: $\omega=2\pi{f}$, $\omega=\frac{{2\pi}}{T}$
Velocity of a wave: $v=\lambda{f}$
$f$ is the frequency
$\lambda$ is the wavelength
$T$ is the period of the wave

In a rope with tension:
Velocity: $V=\sqrt{\frac{F_{T}}{\mu}}$
$F_{T}$ is tension in the rope in Newtons
$\mu$ is the mass of the rope divided my the length of the rope in $\frac{kg}{m}$

Of Note:
Wave speed is proportional to the square root of the tension $F_{T}$
Wave speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass per unit length, $\mu$

The conditions at the end of a rope are called the boundary conditions
