Sound can be described in terms of variation of pressure between points
In sinusoidal sound waves, the pressure fluctuates above and below atmospheric pressure
The maximum pressure is called the pressure amplitude, $p_{max}$

Sound can travel through many different mediums

The human ear is sensitive to frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz

Sound is also used for frequencies above the limit of human hearing, called ultrasonic waves, and below the limit of human hearing, called infrasonic waves

The maximum pressure variation the human ear can handle is 30 Pascals above and below atmospheric pressure, $1.013*10^{5}$ pascals at sea level
