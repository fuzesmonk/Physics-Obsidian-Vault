Verbose: Standing waves are when the wave pattern does not appear to be moving in either direction along a string

Wavelengths: $\lambda_{n}=\frac{2L}{n}$
Units: $m$

Frequency: $f=\frac{\omega}{{2\pi}}$
$\omega$ is angular frequency


To note:
When the wavelength is not equal to one of the values from the above equation, no standing wave is possible
$n$ is the number of antinodes in the wave


Nodes are the points on the wave that do not move 
Anti-nodes are where the amplitude of the wave is greatest

Fundamental Frequency: The smallest frequency when correlated the greatest wavelength is the fundamental frequency, defined as $f_{1}=\frac{v}{{2L}}$

To find the frequency at any point along the standing wave: 
$f_{n}=n\cdot \frac{v}{2L}=nf_{1}$ when $n=1,2,3,4$ and so on

Velocity of a standing wave: $v=\frac{\omega}{k}$
$k$ is the wave number
$\omega$ is the angular frequency

Frequencies corresponding to when $n\geq 2$ are the harmonics/overtones of the fundamental frequency
There are an infinite number of standing wave frequencies, each corresponding to a values of $n$

All of the frequencies when combined in a series is called a **harmonic series**
