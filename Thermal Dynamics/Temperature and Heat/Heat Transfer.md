Fahrenheit to Celsius: $T_{F}=\frac{9}{5}T_{C}+32$
$T_{F}$ is temperature in Fahrenheit
$T_{C}$ is temperature in Celsius

Celsius to Kelvin: $T_{K}=T_{C}+273.15$
$T_{K}$ is temperature in Kelvin
$T_{C}$ is temperature in Celsius


When a substance absorbs or gives off heat, one of two things can happen: 
1. temperature change of the substance
2. physical change of the substance
	- Solid: can melt into a liquid or sublimate directly into a vapor 
	- Liquid: can freeze to become a solid or evaporate to become a vapor
	- Gas: can condense into a liquid or go directly to the solid phase 

If temperature changes:
- identity of the substance may change
- the amount of the substance may change

Specific Heat $\Rightarrow$ specific property of the material
$c=\frac{Q}{{m\Delta{T}}}$
Unit: ${J}$ 

$K$ is kelvin 
$c$ is the specific heat
$Q$ is the amount of heat
$m$ is the mass of the material present
$\Delta{t}$ is the change in temperature

| Substance       | Specific Heat |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Water           | $4.19*10^{3}$ |
| Ethanol         | $2.43*10^{3}$ |
| Ethylene Glycol | $2.39*10^{3}$ |
| **Solids**      |               |
| Aluminum        | $0.91*10^{3}$ |
| Ice             | $2.01*10^{3}$ |
|                |               |

If the change in heat leads to a change in phase:
$Q=mL$

$Q$ is heat
$m$ is mass
$L$ is latent heat


Of note:
Temperature won't change while a phase change is occurring but can happen as soon as the phase stops changing


Change in amount due to heat transfer:
Linear: $\Delta{l} = \alpha l_{0}\Delta{T}$
$\alpha$ : coefficient of linear expansion
