Thermal Energy: Energy that an object contains due to the random motion of its molecules

Temperature: Measure of concentration of an object's internal energy

Heat: Thermal energy that's transmitted from one body to another, basically its energy that is in transit

Fahrenheit to Celsius: $T_{F}=\frac{9}{5}T_{C}+32$
$T_{F}$ is temperature in Fahrenheit
$T_{C}$ is temperature in Celsius

Celsius to Kelvin: $T_{K}=T_{C}+273.15$
$T_{K}$ is temperature in Kelvin
$T_{C}$ is temperature in Celsius
