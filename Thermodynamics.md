[[Thermodynamics and its laws]]
Thermal Energy: Energy that an object contains due to the random motion of its molecules

[[Temperature]]: Measure of concentration of an object's internal energy

Heat: Thermal energy that's transmitted from one body to another, basically its energy that is in transit

[[Latent Heat]]:


[[Heat Transfer|Fahrenheit to Celsius]]: $T_{F} = \frac{9}{5}T_{C}+32$
$T_{C}$ is temperature in Celsius
$T_F$ is temperature in Fahrenheit

[[Heat Transfer|Celsius to Kelvin]]: $T_{K}=T_{C}+273.15$
