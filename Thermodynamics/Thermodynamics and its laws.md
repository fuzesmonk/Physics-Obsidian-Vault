What is thermodynamics?
Thermodynamics is the study of energy transfer that involves work and heat that can result in property changes such as internal energy, temperature, volume and pressure of the system being studied.

The laws of thermodynamics are what prevent perpetual motion machines from being feasible

0th Law: If object A is in thermal equilibrium with object C and object B is in thermal equilibrium with object C, then objects A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other

1st Law: $\Delta{u}=Q+W$
$\Delta{u}$ is the change in internal energy, usually relies on temperature
$Q$ is heat
$W$ is work

Heat Engine: A device that utilizes heat to generate work that can be applied/used by something else

2nd Law: 100% efficiency isn't possible
Two main equations: 
1. $W=Q_{H}-|Q_{c}|$
	- $Q_{H}$ is the heat that comes from a source
	- $Q_{c}$ is the heat that comes out the exhaust
2. Efficiency $e=\frac{Q_{H}-|Q_{c}|}{Q_{H}}$


PV Diagrams: If the gas is able to be worked with in such a way that it and its surroundings are able to remain in thermal equilibrium, the behavior of pressure vs volume is often observed on what is called a PV Diagram

In Thermodynamics, work is defined as: 
$W=F\cdot \Delta{x}$
where $F=P\cdot A$, and $P=\frac{F}{A}$
$W=P\cdot A \cdot \Delta{x}$
which simplifies into $W=-P\Delta{V}$
To note:
The negative is to account for if the change in volume is negative or positive

If a positive amount of work is done: The work done on the gas by its surroundings decreases the volume of the container

If a negative amount of work is done: The work done by the gas on its surroundings increases the volume of the container

Referring to [[Fluid Mechanics]]:
If the pressure stays constant, then work can be found by using $W=-P\Delta{v}$
If the pressure changes, then work can be found using an integral to find the area under the curve
